This dataset is composed by 95 graphs.
95 "attributes" files comprising 232 nodes representing cities in China and their attributes.
95 "edges" files corresponding to links between cities. An average of 13,000 links per file.
The attributes are the following in order: Evolution of the number of new cases, the number of deaths,
and number of recovered patients (-1: Decrease compared to previous time;
0: same number compared with previous time;
1: increase over previous time)
as well as the city size category (0: city with fewer than 500,000 inhabitants; 
1: city with 500,000 to 1 million inhabitants; 
2: city with 1 million to 5 million inhabitants; 
3: cities between 5 and 10 million inhabitants;  
4: city with more than 10 million inhabitants).
The "attributes" files are the aggregation of 4 consecutive days on the evolution of the disease. 
The links are all the flows for these 4 days.
